Challenges are published by the staff. Your task is to solve them. Not all challenges are announced publicly and some are hidden and you need to find them first. The solution to every challenge is a COLOURED EGG (for example: `You found a YELLOW egg`). First person to submit a Pull-Request with their solution wins.
